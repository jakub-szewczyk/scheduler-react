# Scheduler

## Todo

1. Delete schedule confirmation dialog.

2. Consider resizing schedule table and kanban board to fit it more nicely on mobile screens.

3. Notes module.

## Bugs

1. Kanban scrollbar somehow collides with the MUI `<Menu />` component, resulting in an invalid menu position and unnecessary scroll restoration. Unknown steps to reproduce. The bug appears when opening the status and issue context menu.
